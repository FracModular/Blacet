Dark Star Chaos



This is a really interesting one. I believe it was Blacet's first module, 
and the final production run was in October of 2003. Since it was at one point the only module available, it really does a LOT. It's a mini-synth all contained behind a single panel. 
I heard of people mounting these alone in a small box, and using them as self-contained SFX boxes. I believe it.

Basically you have a VCO with PWM, a digital noise generator (with a VC'd clock),
a VC'd LPF to process the noise, an A/D envelope generator, and a gate control (on/off/momentary).
Not very powerful as a VCO replacement, however incredible fun an inspiring both as a sci-fi sound effects type box,
as well as a noise generator, either for noise sounds or to get noise for modulation. 
This really goes far beyond the common noise generator module, with the VCO and snappy A/D EG. 
Just amazing for spaceship sounds, weather storms, and alien chatter. 
These were made by Cyndustries briefly in their format, 
and many MOTM'ers have built them behind MOTM faceplate.

These are becoming basically impossible to find - I haven't seen one come up for sale
in well over a year now. I think you would expect to pay $250 or so for one, but this is a ballpark guess.

Interesting modifications include the ability 
(already stuffed on the PCB by Blacet! Just add jacks) to have CV inputs for both the Attack and Decay time in the EG.

"I've got two Dark Stars and they are among the coolest sound generators I've ever played with." --DT

"I received my Dark Star a few days ago and...WOW!!! What an AWESOME little box!!! I can't put it down! As a noise head, I'm sure one won't be enough pretty soon." --LG

"I recently put together a 22 module system and this is one of the best pieces in it IMO. It blends in perfectly with the more vanilla modules and all the VC stuff allows me to tweak and warp sounds out of basic VCOs and VCFs that I could never do otherwise." --DT2
When the Dark Star first appeared in 1982, the brochure had the following description:

"Need an amazing source of synthesized sounds at an absurd price? Here you go....a noise oriented prepatched minisynthesizer built around a powerful LSI chip. 

The Dark Star TM provides a digital noise source with variable clock, plus a noise filter, LFO, VCO, VCA and envelope generator; a whole panel of synthesizer modules in just a tiny 6 x 4 x 3" package... 

You can use it to simulate all those surf, wind, rain, cymbal, explosion, spaceships hurtling across the void and warping out type sounds. Careful design and wide range controls give you a real sound exploration tool; don't be fooled by the low price. Try it as a percussion kit addition, a drone voice, even as a modulation source. The Dark Star just doesn't sound like anything else--we guarantee it!" 

Unavailable for many years, the Dark Star now makes a swing through our planetary system.... 

This reissue of the Dark Star uses the same basic circuit and updates the design with expanded control ranges and CV inputs for the Noise Clock, Noise Filter, VCO and PWM. Use it as a standalone sound generator or interface it with a modular system for some truly wild sounds! 

With the interest in chaos theory and fractals in the past few years, this unit provides an excellent means to explore the effects of chaotic (noise) modulation. The results cover quite a wide range from the haunting to the apocalyptic...

The size has been altered to fit a 5.25 (3U) high standard rack space and has mounting holes drilled for the PAiA FracRak. (The DSC will sort of fit in the Doepfer system.  However, their rack case has 2mm lips on the top and bottom which makes their panel size 4mm smaller than standard. We can supply a Doepfer power connector at no extra charge.

The PCB and front panel are professionally designed and fabricated. All pots are PCB mounted--no panel wiring required except for the jacks. The kit includes all parts and assembly instructions. Note that a basic bipolar power supply is required.

The Texas Instruments SN76477N

If you're new to Synth DIY and have never heard of the SN76477 IC, there's a good reason - it's long been out of production. But it still exists out there in the wild - a few supply houses on the internet still list it, and it's been known to inhabit parts bins all over the world waiting for just the right application.

Basically, the SN76477 is a fully loaded synthesizer on a chip. Within its silicon boundaries lie the following functions:

* A Voltage Controlled Square Wave Oscillator
* A Super Low Frequency Oscillator (a fancy term for LFO)
* A VCA-like 'modulator'
* A Sweepable Digital Noise Generator (shift register based)
* A Filter for the Digital Noise Generator
* An Envelope Generator (Attack/Decay)
* A programmable Mixer

The SN76477 appeared in many a video game of the late '70s and early '80s, supplying players with bleeps, bloops and swept noise as they vanquished pixellated aliens dropping from the skies. It was also featured in other items, more often than not, toys. There were a few kits out there for hobbyists. Some were music related, others were for just making making revving engine, steam engine, explosion and gunshot effects. Somewhere between the mid '80s and early '90s (I'm not sure when) Texas Instruments terminated the SN76477. With prejudice.

The SN76477 didn't die its ignoble death in vain. There were a couple of serious synth applications developed for it. In his book "Build a Better Music Synthesizer", Thomas Henry published a design for a controller module, dubbed "The SuperController" based around the SN76477. In this application, the SN76477 was primarily used as a source for syncable gates, triggers, and LFO signals, but it did also feature the sweepable digital noise generator as a signal output.

John Blacet brought the SN76477 into the commercial synthesizer world with his excellent "Dark Star Chaos" module, a discontinued and still much-sought-after design produced by his company, Blacet Research. The DSC2000 took great advantage of the SN76477's capabilities. Its application was for creating sounds ranging from the sublime to the monstrous. One can still read about its functionality on the Blacet history page here:

Blacet Research Cool Old Stuff Page

Other than the DSC2000 and the SuperController, I've heard of a few 'cigar box' synthesizers mentioned on the Synth DIY list, but, other than the hobbyist items mentioned above, nothing else.

So why didn't more synth based designs using the SN76477 pop up everywhere - why did it shuffle off of this mortal coil remembered mainly as an IC that was great for making unusual sound effects and little else? After all, it has all of these features......

The one feature that the SN76477 lacked, when viewed from the perspective of us analog synthesizer diehards, is that there was no terribly effective means for controlling it in a scaled musical sense. The control for the VCO is 'linear' and not in that nice Korg V/Hz context, either. What 'mini-organ' hobby projects I've seen for it invariably involve a few keys with specific resistors controlling the amount of voltage each key sends. Even the Blacet Dark Star chaos is intended more for sound effect generation - a specific note is made that the VCO is not intended for accurate keyboard use.

I'm sure there are a few other reasons. For example, the SN76477 produces only two audio signals - a square (or pulse) wave and a digital noise signal. It doesn't have a full-on ADSR envelope generator, and its envelopes are not the snappiest in the world. Those are minor, workable things, but that VCO control voltage - well that's a show stopper.

More specifically, it was a show-stopper until 2006, long after the SN76477 passed into oblivion and three years after the last DSC2000 left Blacet's doors. Thomas had one of those "Hey, wait a minute" moments and began calculating, breadboarding, and calculating even more. In a nutshell, Thomas came up with a means to control the SN76477 exponentially - true V/Oct for a range of five octaves or so with reasonable accuracy.

To put what he accomplished into perspective, listen to this demo of the SN-Voice that Thomas produced. It consists of a composition by JS Bach using an organ voice, crystal controlled, from Thomas' sound card and the SN-Voice singing along with it. No filter is used on the SN-Voice (PWM), and it uses the internal EG, LFO and VCA of the SN76477N, which lies at the heart of the SN-Voice. A light touch of reverb was used.


So, there you have it - the Texas Instruments SN76477's final revenge, doing things no data sheet or application ever hinted it was capable of.

The SN-Voice Module

Once Thomas had established the breakthrough of controlling the SN76477's VCO exponentially, attention was turned to exactly what to do with it. Ideas began to come together, and over the space of week, through a flurry of communication and breadboarding, a design began taking shape. In typical Thomas Henry fashion, a lot of functionality was gleaned out of very few parts, thus was born the SN-Voice module.

The SN-Voice provides the following:

* V/Oct VCO with Square or PWM (modulated by either LFO or EG) output. This output can be switched between pulse/square output or digital noise output. The amplitude of this output can be controlled by the envelope generator or be locked to a constant output amplitude. Output is 10Vp-p max, with an output volume control.

* VCO Triangle wave output. This output is a constant 10Vp-p and is not controlled by the envelope generator.

* VCO is controlled by a V/Oct control voltage input, an expo modulation input (with associated level control), a linear modulation input which can be either AC or DC coupled and also has a level control, a coarse tune control and a fine tune control.

* Sweepable Digital Noise Generator

* The Digital Noise Generator can be controlled by a keyboard control voltage input and an expo modulation input, which has an associated expo modulation level control.

* Manually adjustable Noise Filter.

* Wide range triangle wave LFO (less than .2 Hz to over 200 Hz over three ranges) and 10Vp-p output. Frequency of the LFO is set manually.

* A gated ASR (attack/sustain/release) envelope generator that is active when the pulse/noise output is set for EG. Output is 0 to 5V. Maximum attack and decay time is approximately 6.5 seconds each. The envelope generator accepts +5V gate signals and will remain high as long as the gate is applied.
