VCA2200 Kit Alert

If you have recently purchased a VCA Kit, one of the pages of the assembly section was omitted.


Insert and solder the diodes: D2 and D3; 1N4001, black, marked. (1N4002 may also be used). Note the orientation.
*
Insert and solder the reference diode: D1; LM4040. This is a TO-92 package. Note the orientation.
Insert and solder the polyswitches PS1 and PS2. These yellowish capacitor-like devices (marked “L010”) can be inserted in any direction.
Take a resistor clipping and form a small loop to put in the two holes at TP1. Solder. By keeping the loop raised above the PCB, a “grabber” type of DMM probe can be connected for testing.
Insert and solder the power input jack, J11; note the orientation as shown by the silkscreen.
You can now remove the flux from the PCB. If you use water cleanable solder, use lukewarm water (110F) and an old toothbrush. You will see a bit of foam as you brush and the board will clean up with very little effort. Avoid using water that is too hot as it may cause the board to warp. You should wash the board in any case if you are going to finish the board the next day or later. The 331 flux has a slight acid base and can cause a bit of frostiness on the solder joint if left on for more than a few hours.
It is important to rinse off with DI or distilled water as a final step. This removes any mineral deposits that might cause electrical leakage and eliminates water spots.
Use “No Clean” Kester 245 type solder for the remaining components. Do not use a “331” type solder as corrosion can occur if the flux is not removed.
Insert and solder the pots: R1 thru R5. Note that R5 is a center detent type.
It is important to mount the pots correctly as they line up with holes in the front panel. Tack solder them in place via ONE of their mounting tabs. Reheat the tab while pressing down on the top of the pot (PCB held with one finger, pot top with another). As the solder remelts, the pot will snap down into position.
Check the alignment by sighting down the back and front of the row of pots. Also  make sure that they are sitting flat on the PCB by looking at them head-on. When you are satisfied with the pot mounting, complete the soldering.
Wire the power connector using the red, white, and black wire provided along with the crimp pins and molex housing. A crimp tool is usually used (Mouser PN 538-11-01-0015 ), although you can bend the tabs by hand and solder the wires in place.  Be sure to use the suggested color code and place the pins in the proper position.  Red = +15, white = -15, black = common. Use the heatshrink to bundle the wires near each connector.
*
The pins will slide into the housing and snap in place via a tiny tab. They can be removed by depressing the area near the tab with a tiny screwdriver.

1. Strip wire 0.1 to .125” and insert in crimp pin. (Wire must not extend past the end of the crimp tabs or it may interfere with the operation of the spring connector.)
2. Crimp and/or solder wire to pin.
3. Insert pin in housing until locking tab engages in housing window.

By now, the board should be completely dry, so you can test the power supplies. (Leaving the ICs uninstalled avoids any damage due to PS problems.) Connect the board to a regulated +15/-15V supply.
Connect your DMM common to the left side of D2 and check the right side of D2 for +15V.
Check the right side of D3 for -15V.
Check the left side of R13 for  5V (D1).
