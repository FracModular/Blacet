Filthy Filtre Kit Alert

Under Calibration, the procedure for RT3 neglects to mention running the filter in self oscillation mode. The revised text is below.

RT3, Null: This sets the center “off” position of front panel pot R3 (Mod Attn) to as close to zero volts as possible. The fastest method is to insert an external VCO at the mod input jack running at sub audio frequencies. Select F as the Destination  and monitor the Filtre Out via mixer or amp (turn up the Frequency pot).  Do not use an audio input, instead turn up the Q control until the filter oscillates. With R3 at center detent, turn the trimmer for minimum VCO effect.

VCO Kit Alert

A couple folks have noticed a typo in the manual which labels 0.1uF mylar cap C2 "105". "104" is the correct cap label.

Two resistor values have been changed: R38 to 560 and R30 to 3M. Since all boards are prestuffed with the resistors, these values have been changed on all boards currently shipping. These changes are not in the current manual, however.

These changes give more consistent sawtooth levels (R38) and more consistent HF tracking results (R30). If you bought a early kit and notice problems in either of these areas, changing the resistors is a good idea. Most kits, however, will be OK.

TOTM (Tool of the Month)

IC pin straightener.

"What! I don't need this, I'm careful and don't bend my pins!"

Well, you need to bend them to get them into the PCB or socket, and they
normally come splayed out.

This little gizmo works like a charm; wish I'd had it 500 modules ago!

Jameco (.com) PN 99362CP, $7.35. Conductive plastic, of course.

BZ2300 Kit Alert
The first run of manuals did not have the wire lengths for the front panel wiring. Here they are:

R7: 3" for all three wires

J1: com=6.2, signal=2.7, switch=2.5
J2: com=6.3, signal=2.1
J3: com=6.1, signal=1.5
J4: com=7.3, strip 0.9 (shared with J5), signal=2.1
J5: com=see J4, signal=2.1
J6: com=7, signal=2.3, switch=2.1

S1: 4.2" for all three wires
