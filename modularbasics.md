### What is a modular synthesizer?

A modular synth has its name derived from the fact that its a synth consisting of separate specialized modules. 
The modules are not hardwired together by the manufacturer but can be connected together with patch cords, 
or a matrix patching system, or switches by the user to create a patch. 

The output (voltages) from the modules may function as (audio) signals, control voltages, or logic/timing conditions. 
Typical modules are:
- oscillators (operate on frequency), 
- filters (spectrum)
- amplifiers/gates (amplitude) 
- envelope generators (dynamic control)
