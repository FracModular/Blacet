EG2070 Kit Alert

If you have recently purchased an EG1 kit, check the 4046 IC for a Fairchild logo (F). 
If you see any other brand, it may not work properly in the circuit. 
The indicator LED for the Time Base will blink normally at the shortest TB setting 
but stop blinking at any other setting. The TB itself will work OK; 
it's just the indicator that's the problem. 

E-mail us for a replacement IC if necessary.
