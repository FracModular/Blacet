Reducing Distortion Levels in the Time Machine
To significantly reduce the possibility of the TM going into hard clipping with large levels of regeneration, 
we are advising that R43, currently 100K, be changed to 150K. 
This resistor is available at no charge to TM owners upon request. 
We will also modify factory assembled units under warranty for customers who cannot do this themselves.

This type of clipping is audible as a "crackling" sound and is easier to hear with waveforms such as a triangle or sine. 
Pulse/square waves or other content with a lot of harmonics will tend to mask the distortion.

Missing Trace on the Mini Wave PCB
Pin 5 of U6 should be connected to +5V. Pin 1 of U6 is the closest spot to jumper to. 
The MW may work correctly without this jumper, but it is best to make the modification for reliability. 
If you purchased an assembled unit, we will fix this under warranty.
