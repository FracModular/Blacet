# Frac Modular 


## This repo is for dedicated to the preservation of information for the Frac Modular format.

### What is a modular synthesizer?

A modular synth has its name derived from the fact that its a synth consisting of separate specialized modules. 
The modules are not hardwired together by the manufacturer but can be connected together with patch cords, 
or a matrix patching system, or switches by the user to create a patch. 

The output (voltages) from the modules may function as (audio) signals, control voltages, or logic/timing conditions. 
Typical modules are:
- oscillators (operate on frequency), 
- filters (spectrum)
- amplifiers/gates (amplitude) 
- envelope generators (dynamic control)




## Some modules that work on +/- 15V so they are suitable for Frac DIY

### 4ms:

Shuffling Clock Multiplier: works on +/-12-15v

Rotating Clock Divider: works on +/-12-15v

Noise Swash: works on +/-9-15v

Atoner: works on +/-12-15v 


### Flight of Harmony:

Choices: operates on +/-9-15V

Plague Bearer: operates on +/-9-15V

V'Amp: operates on +/-9-15V

Sound of Shadows: operates on +/-12-15v


### Blacet to Doepfer Power Connector

Some Blacet Modules will work on +/-12V and some Doepfer Modules will work on +/-15V...
